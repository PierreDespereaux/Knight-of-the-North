The love the Divine Crusader and the lore surrounding the Knights of the Nine. I was happy to see the titular armor set get added to the Creation Club, but thoroughly disappointed at the quest you were sent on to obtain it. This is my attempt at overhauling the Relics of the Crusader quest and making it more interesting and immersive.

Find a Crusader Relic to begin the quest!

-   A completely reworked quest for obtaining the relics of the Crusader.
-   Participant in a province-wide scavenger hunt to reunite the lost relics.
-   An interesting background narrative that explains how the Relics got to Skyrim.
-   A non-linear experience that focuses more on in-world clues than quest markers.
